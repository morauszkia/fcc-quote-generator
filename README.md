# Random Quote Generator

Built for the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Certification Project: [Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine).
Original version used class components and was written as a single file.
I refactored the app to use functional components, and declared components in separate files. I also used `styled-components` to scope styling to components.
The project uses the [Quotable API](https://docs.quotable.io/docs/api/ZG9jOjQ2NDA2-introduction) to fetch random quotes.
